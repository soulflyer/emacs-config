;;; Commentary:

;; Not even sure if this works yet, as this file will be run before lsp
;; is required. However it works when running it by hand.

;;; Code:

(setq lsp-clojure-server-command '("/opt/homebrew/bin/clojure-lsp")
      org-ditaa-jar-path "/opt/homebrew/Cellar/ditaa/0.11.0_1/libexec/ditaa-0.11.0-standalone.jar")

(provide 'iw-acceptance)
;;; iw-acceptance.el ends here
